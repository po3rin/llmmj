### Thinking Example 1
- Problem: Create a problem where the answer is 3 han 40 fu
- Thinking process:
    - Consider what hand and wait shape would result in 40 fu
        - Base fu: 20 fu
        - One simple ankou (2-8 triplet): 4 fu
        - Menzen ron (closed hand): 10 fu
        - Tanki wait: 2 fu
        - Total: 36 fu, rounded up to 40 fu

    - Hand: 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 5m, 5m, 6p, 7p, 8p, 3s, 4s, 5s, 7s
        - Riichi declared
        - Ron with 7s (tanki wait)
        - Dora indicator is 4m, so dora is 5m (have 3 of them)
        - Answer: 3 han 40 fu

### Thinking Example 2
- Problem: Create a problem where the answer is 2 han 50 fu
- Thinking process:
    - Consider what hand and wait shape would result in 50 fu
        - Base fu: 20 fu
        - One terminal/honor ankou: 8 fu
        - One simple ankou: 4 fu
        - Menzen ron: 10 fu
        - Kanchan wait: 2 fu
        - Total: 44 fu, rounded up to 50 fu
    - Consider what yaku are needed for 2 han
        - Riichi: 1 han
        - 1 dora: 1 han
        - Total: 2 han
    - Hand: 1m, 1m, 1m, 3m, 5m, 6m, 7m, 3p, 3p, 3p, 5s, 6s, 7s
        - Riichi declared
        - Ron with 4m (kanchan wait between 3m-5m)
        - Dora indicator is 2m, so dora is 3m
        - Answer: 2 han 50 fu

### Thinking Example 3
- Problem: Create a problem where the answer is 4 han 70 fu
- Thinking process:
    - Consider what hand and wait shape would result in 70 fu
        - Base fu: 20 fu
        - One closed kan of terminals: 32 fu
        - One terminal ankou: 8 fu
        - Menzen ron: 10 fu
        - Total: 70 fu
    - Consider what yaku are needed for 4 han
        - Sanankou: 2 han
        - 2 dora: 2 han
        - Total: 4 han
    - Hand: 9m, 9m, 9m, 9m, 1p, 1p, 1p, 4s, 5s, 6s, 8s, 8s, 8s
        - Closed kan of 9m declared
        - Ron with 7s (ryanmen wait)
        - Dora indicator is 8m, so dora is 9m (have 4 in kan)
        - Answer: 4 han 70 fu
